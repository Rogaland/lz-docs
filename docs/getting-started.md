## Getting started

If this is your first time here, we recommend that you read through the documentation first before starting with deployments.
The documentation is intended for you with basic knowledge of IT concepts such as storage, networking and VMs.

We will do our best to describe and guide you through the steps deploying services in Azure. If you feel that something is missing, don't hesitate to click the "edit on GitHub link" in the top right corner and register an `Issue` to let us know.
